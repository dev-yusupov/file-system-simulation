# Exception Handling in File System Simulation

## Overview

This document outlines the exception handling mechanisms used in the file system simulation project built in Python. Proper exception handling ensures that the system can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Custom Exceptions

### FileSystemError

`FileSystemError` is the base class for all custom exceptions in the file system simulation.

```python
class FileSystemError(Exception):
    """Base class for file system exceptions."""
    pass
```

### FileNotFoundError

Raised when a file or directory is not found.

```python
class FileNotFoundError(FileSystemError):
    """Raised when a file or directory is not found."""
    pass
```

### FileExistsError

Raised when attempting to create a file or directory that already exists.

```python
class FileExistsError(FileSystemError):
    """Raised when a file or directory already exists."""
    pass
```

### PermissionError

Raised when an operation is not permitted due to insufficient permissions.

```python
class PermissionError(FileSystemError):
    """Raised when an operation is not permitted."""
    pass
```

### DiskFullError

Raised when there is no more space left on the disk.

```python
class DiskFullError(FileSystemError):
    """Raised when the disk is full."""
    pass
```

## Exception Handling Strategies

### Try-Except Blocks

Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    pass
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except FileExistsError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except PermissionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except DiskFullError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except FileSystemError as e:
    print(f"An unexpected file system error occurred: {e}")
```

### Logging

Log exceptions to help with debugging and monitoring.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    pass
except FileSystemError as e:
    logging.error(f"File system error: {e}")
```

### Raising Exceptions

Raise exceptions to signal errors that cannot be handled locally.

```python
def create_file(file_path):
    if file_exists(file_path):
        raise FileExistsError(f"The file '{file_path}' already exists.")
    # Code to create the file
```
