# DevOps Operations Documentation

## Release Management

In this project, release management is a structured process to ensure smooth transitions from development to production. We follow a detailed plan to maintain the integrity of our environments.

- **Planning:** Define the release scope and schedule in collaboration with all stakeholders.
- **Build:** Use our CI pipeline to compile and package the code.
- **Testing:** Conduct automated and manual tests to ensure quality.
- **Deployment:** Deploy releases to staging and then to production after approval.
- **Review:** Post-release, we review the process and outcomes to identify improvements.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Our CI process ensures that code changes are integrated and tested frequently to catch issues early. We use automated tools to streamline this process.

- **Code Commit:** Developers commit changes to the shared repository multiple times a day.
- **Automated Build:** GitHub Actions is used to automatically compile and build the code.
- **Automated Testing:** Run unit and integration tests using pytest and other testing frameworks.
- **Feedback:** Immediate feedback is provided to developers through GitHub Actions notifications.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery in our project ensures that every change is deployable. We automate the deployment process to reduce manual intervention and increase reliability.

- **Automated Deployment:** Code is automatically deployed to staging environments using GitHub Actions.
- **Release Automation:** We use GitHub Actions to automate the release process to production.
- **Monitoring:** Applications are continuously monitored using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Rollback:** Implement rollback strategies using version control and deployment tools to revert changes if necessary.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control:** All code changes are managed using Git.
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive tests are automated to ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Developers receive continuous feedback through CI/CD tools.
